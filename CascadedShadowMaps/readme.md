# Cascaded Shadow Maps

![](screenshot.png)

This is a MonoGame port of Matt Pattineo's Shadows Sample:  
https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/shadow-maps/

MJP's shadows sample was released under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).

Only a limited subset of options from MJP's shadows sample have been ported.
Specifically, for shadow filtering, only the Optimized PCF option has been implemented.

The 3D buildings model used in this sample was downloaded from:

**Note**: This sample uses features that were added to MonoGame after the v3.3 release.
So you need to either [download a development build](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/),
or wait for v3.4.
